Punchball is an orginal 2D arcade boxing game for iPhone, built on [Cocos2d framework for iPhone](http://www.cocos2d-iphone.org).

Technically the two most interesting features are a bit unconventional physics simulation, leveraging [Chimpunk engine](http://code.google.com/p/chipmunk-physics/) and peer-to-peer multiplayer gaming via Bluetooth, which is simple on the surface, but in practice requires all kinds of tricks for latency compensation.
